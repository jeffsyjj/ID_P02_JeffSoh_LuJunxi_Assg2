# Project Name: Juff
Hello fellow shoppers! Are you sick of going to multiple shoe stores just to look for the latest hype shoe?
It's a hassle, isn't it? Fear not! In Juff, we have partnered with multiple famous shoe brands such as
Adidas, Nike, Puma and many more! The best part is you're able to shop comfortably anywhere either at
your home or even your workplace(We won't tell your boss, don't worry!) with no additional charge! This
means that you will be getting the same price in all of the shoe stores in Juff. So what are you
waiting for? Shop in Juff today!

# Design Process:
This website is actually for everyone, we have shoes for both genders, male and female. Hype shoes only.

As mentioned earlier on, a lot of people love shopping for shoes, they would then have to go to multiple
shoe brand website or head to the store in person to find their desired shoe, this is a hassle.
Hence, with our project JUFF, they are able to browse through hype heated shoes at once when shopping on
our website, this would greatly save them a lot of time.

As a shopper, due to the current pandemic and high rising number of covid cases, they would prefer to
shop online instead of heading out to get their desired shoe. Our project JUFF will be able to help them get their shoe delivered to their house conveniently. This allows them to lessen the number of times they step out of their house which lowers the risk of them getting infected.

## Features
Featuring my website features.
### Existing Features
- Mobile responsiveness - This allows users to browse the website on mobile. 
- Navigation bar - Multiple navigation buttons to allow users to navigate within the website itself as well as one login button which navigates to another website. It stays at the top of the website when the user scrolls to ensure that users can navigate to different sections of the website instead of having to scroll all the way back up. For mobile, the navigation bar is a slider navigation bar. The animation effect is created using CSS.
- Buttons - Most buttons have cool gradient designs and links user to other websites. 
- Footer - Located at the very bottom of the page, footer contains my website rights as well as social media links where users can contact me. The 'JUFF' logo allows users to head back to the main page.
- Highlights - Using CSS, when a user hover their cursor over certain items, it changes the colour of the pointed items. For example, when hovering cursor over the navigation buttons, the button highlights into purple.
- JavaScript - Javascript is used to make the mobile navigation slider effect. It is used to open and close the navigation mobile bar. Also, for mobile view, Javascript is used to open the navigation bar menu and close the menu once the user clicks the navigation button and is lead to that particular section of the website.
### Future features
- Login page - Created another html webpage for users to login or sign up to become a member.
- Add to cart - This allows users to add shoes that they would like to purchase to the cart for checkout
- Wheel of coins - This is a reward system where users can get up to 10 coins every day from a roulette wheel and every coin is equal to $0.10 which can be used for their purchases lowering the price
