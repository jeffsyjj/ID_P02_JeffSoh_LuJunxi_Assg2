# Project Name: Juff
Hello fellow shoppers! Are you sick of going to multiple shoe stores just to look for the latest hype shoe?
It's a hassle, isn't it? Fear not! In Juff, we have partnered with multiple famous shoe brands such as
Adidas, Nike, Puma and many more! The best part is you're able to shop comfortably anywhere either at
your home or even your workplace(We won't tell your boss, don't worry!) with no additional charge! This
means that you will be getting the same price in all of the shoe stores in Juff. So what are you
waiting for? Shop in Juff today!

# Design Process:
This website is actually for everyone, we have shoes for both genders, male and female. Hype shoes only.

As mentioned earlier on, a lot of people love shopping for shoes, they would then have to go to multiple
shoe brand website or head to the store in person to find their desired shoe, this is a hassle.
Hence, with our project JUFF, they are able to browse through hype heated shoes at once when shopping on
our website, this would greatly save them a lot of time.

As a shopper, due to the current pandemic and high rising number of covid cases, they would prefer to
shop online instead of heading out to get their desired shoe. Our project JUFF will be able to help them get their shoe delivered to their house conveniently. This allows them to lessen the number of times they step out of their house which lowers the risk of them getting infected.

## Features
Featuring my website features.
### Existing Features
- Mobile responsiveness - This allows users to browse the website on mobile.
- Logo - Designed a simple and nice logo instead of a plain text.
- Navigation bar - Multiple navigation buttons to allow users to navigate within the website itself as well as one login button which navigates to another website. It stays at the top of the website when the user scrolls to ensure that users can navigate to different sections of the website instead of having to scroll all the way back up. For mobile, the navigation bar is a slider navigation bar. The animation effect is created using CSS.
- Buttons - Most buttons have cool gradient designs and links user to other websites. The animation effect is also created using CSS
- Highlights - Using CSS, when a user hover their cursor over certain items, it changes the colour of the pointed items. For example, when hovering cursor over the navigation buttons, the button highlights into purple.
- JavaScript - Javascript is used to make the mobile navigation slider effect. It is used to open and close the navigation mobile bar. Also, for mobile view, Javascript is used to open the navigation bar menu and close the menu once the user clicks the navigation button and is lead to that particular section of the website. Javascript is also used a lot for our quiz game.
- Add to cart - Users are able to add their desired shoes to the cart and check out to payment
- Checkout - This allows users to checkout and buy stuffs
- Collection - This shows users what shoes will we be adding soon to the website
### Future features
- We can change the theme of the page for future events like Christmas and National Day
# Technologies Used:
This project uses Open Trivia Database as a Quiz Question API: https://opentdb.com/
I decided to use this Database as not only is it free to use, there is also a lot of users provided and verified questions.

This project uses Html, Css and Javascript. We used these programming languages and Markup Language to design our website as they are languages commonly used to design websites.

We have used w3schools: https://www.w3schools.com/
This has many lessons to help us figure out errors on our code and how to create certain stuffs for example the class loadgame for game.html which is basically a loader to give the website some time to fetch the questions from the API.

We have also used LottieFiles: https://lottiefiles.com/
We used quite a few animation from this website such as the front page shoe animation and the quiz page shoe animation
