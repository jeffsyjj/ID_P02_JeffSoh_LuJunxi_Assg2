# Project Name: Juff
Hello fellow shoppers! Are you sick of going to multiple shoe stores just to look for your desired shoe
It's a hassle, isn't it? Fear not! In Juff, we have partnered with multiple famous shoe brands such as
Adidas, Nike, Puma and many more!  The best part is you're able to shop comfortably anywhere either at
your home or even your workplace(We wont tell your boss, dont worry!) with no additional charge! This
means that you will be getting the exact same price in all of the shoe stores in Juff. So what are you
waiting for? Shop in Juff today!

# Design Process:
This website is actually for everyone, we have shoes for both genders, there is also a kids section.

As mentioned earlier on, a lot of people love shopping for shoes, they would then have to earlier go to
the shoe brand website or head to the store in person to get their desired shoe, this is a hassle.
Hence, with our project JUFF, they are able to browse through multiple brands at once when shopping on
our website, this would greatly save them a lot of time.

As a shopper, due to the current pandemic and high rising number of covid cases, they were perfer to
shop online instead heading out to get their desired shoe. Our project JUFF, will be able to help them get their shoe delivered to their house conveniently. This allows them to lessen down the number of times they step out of their house which lowers the risk of them getting infected.
